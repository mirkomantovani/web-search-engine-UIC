  <strong>Welcome to UIC!</strong>
Once you activate your UIC NetID and password, use it to access most authenticated University of Illinois computing 
and networking services (e.g., Self-Service Enterprise applications like Student Registration & Records, Financial Aid) 
as well as UIC campus-based services like email, Blackboard, Wifi and computer labs. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>One NetID. One Password.</strong>
Your new NetID is a unique identifier assigned to you.  It becomes part of your UIC email address (<b>NetID@uic.edu</b>) and is your login name for these services.

<p>A secure and well-managed password is key to protecting your access to University of Illinois computing resources.  
The activation process includes setting up password recovery options for self-service management so that you will be 
prepared, in advance, if you need to recover your password.  
</p>

<p><b>Are you a new UIC employee?</b>  You will create your NetID and password in <b><a target=_blank href='https://newhire.uihr.uillinois.edu/cf/newlog.cfm'>UI New Hire</a></b>.

   Conditions For Use of Academic Computing and Communications Center
   (ACCC) Services & Facilities
   
   All users have the responsibility to use the ACCC (Academic Computing
   and Communications Center) computing services in an efficient,
   ethical, and legal manner. Users of the ACCC computer facilities are
   expected to abide by the following policies, which are intended to
   preserve the utility and flexibility of the computer system, protect
   the work of students, staff, and faculty, and preserve the right to
   access networks to which the University is connected.
   
   You will be assigned an ACCC computer account to access ACCC computer
   facilities. The University reserves the right to access your account
   and the system to the extent necessary to investigate security
   breaches or other infractions of these rules. Your own password will
   allow access to your account and you may not allow any other person to
   use your account for any reason. In addition, it is your
   responsibility to protect your account from unauthorized use by
   changing passwords periodically and using passwords that are not
   easily guessed.
   
   Identify yourself clearly and accurately in electronic communications.
   Concealing or misrepresenting your name or affiliation to mask
   irresponsible or offensive behavior is a serious abuse. Using
   identifiers of other individuals as your own constitutes fraud.
   
   You are expected to take proper care of the equipment in ACCC
   facilities. Eating, drinking, and smoking are not allowed in UIC labs
   (i.e., food and beverages are not allowed). Report any malfunction to
   the consultant on duty or send e-mail to consult@uic.edu. Do not
   attempt to move, repair, reconfigure, modify, or attach external
   devices to the systems. In addition, individual ACCC computer
   laboratories can post additional operational rules and restrictions
   that are considered part of the ACCC computer policy. You are
   responsible for reading and following these rules.
   
   Accept limitations or restrictions on computing resources, such as
   storage space, time limits, or amount of resources consumed, when
   asked to do so by the system administrators. Such restrictions are
   designed to ensure fair access for all users. You are expected to use
   computing resources in a responsible and efficient manner consistent
   with the instructional, research, and administrative goals of the
   University.
   
   Accept responsibility for your own work by learning appropriate uses
   of software to maintain the integrity of what you create. Keep
   archives and backup copies of important work; learn and properly use
   the features for securing or sharing access to your files on any
   computers you use.
   
   While great effort is made to keep the contents of what you create,
   store, and send to be seen only by those to whom you intend or give
   permission, the University cannot and does not guarantee the security
   of electronic files on its computer systems. These systems can
   sometimes be breached by someone determined to do so. Additionally, as
   specified above, the University reserves the right to access its
   computer systems, including your account, if it deems it appropriate.
   
   You are expected to refrain from engaging in deliberate wasteful
   practices such as multi-user dungeons (MUDs), sending chain letters
   through electronic mail, printing unnecessary output, printing
   multiple copies of files, performing unnecessary computations,
   generating excessive network traffic, or unnecessarily holding public
   PCs or dial-up phone lines for long periods of time when others are
   waiting for these resources. Academic work always has priority over
   other authorized uses.
   
   You are expected to refrain from installing or using unauthorized
   software, and in particular, software that creates security risks on
   University computer facilities. Other programs may be restricted by
   the departmental system administrators and will be announced through
   appropriate channels.
   
   Unauthorized transferring of copyrighted materials to or from the ACCC
   computer system without express consent of the owner is a violation of
   federal law. In addition, use of the Internet for commercial gain,
   profit, or advertisement is not allowed from UIC.
   
   Use of electronic mail and other network communications facilities to
   harass, offend, or annoy other users of the network is forbidden. All
   users need to be aware that obscene, defamatory, or any other material
   which violates University policy on non-discrimination will not be
   tolerated at UIC. The University reserves the right to take whatever
   action it sees as appropriate to prevent, correct, or discipline
   behavior that violates this policy.
   
   Any attempt to circumvent system security, guess other passwords, or
   in any way gain unauthorized access to local or network resources is
   forbidden. Distributing passwords or otherwise attempting to evade,
   disable, or "crack" passwords or other security provisions threatens
   the work of many others and is therefore grounds for immediate
   suspension of your privileges. You may not develop programs or use any
   mechanisms to alter or avoid accounting for the use of computing
   services or to employ means by which the facilities and systems are
   used anonymously or by means of an alias.
   
   Access to and utilization of the resources of ACCC computing services
   is a privilege and NOT a right; they can be withdrawn or curtailed
   forthwith and without notice if there is a reason to believe that the
   user has or may have violated this policy or applicable law.
   Additionally, violation of this policy can result in further
   discipline under the appropriate procedures extant at UIC or by civil
   or criminal prosecution. All users, as a condition of their access to
   or utilization of ACCC computing services, agree to cooperate in every
   way with the Computer Center in an investigation of alleged
   improprieties or abuse of this privilege and waive any right of
   confidentiality. Failure to cooperate fully with the Computer Center
   shall be considered a violation of policy.
   
   The ACCC will investigate apparent or alleged violations of these
   guidelines. The Academic Computing and Communications Center also
   reserves the right to immediately suspend user privileges for
   potential violations of these guidelines to the extent necessary to
   protect the security and integrity of the ACCC computer system. When
   appropriate, at the discretion of the ACCC, cases of apparent abuse
   will be reported to the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs (student
   cases), to the Assistant Vice President for Human Resources (academic
   professional and support staff cases), or to the Provost (faculty
   cases). These respective offices are responsible for determining any
   further disciplinary actions.
   
   Issues concerning these guidelines, or allegations of harassment or
   other irresponsible use of computing resources, should be brought to
   the attention of the Academic Computing and Communications Center by
   sending electronic mail to consult@uic.edu.
