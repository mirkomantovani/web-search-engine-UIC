<b>Abstract: </b>

<i>Lifelong Machine Learning</i>, Second Edition is an introduction to an advanced machine learning
paradigm that continuously learns by accumulating past knowledge that it then uses in future
learning and problem solving. In contrast, the current dominant machine learning paradigm
learns in isolation: given a training dataset, it runs a machine learning algorithm on the dataset
to produce a model that is then used in its intended application. It makes no attempt to retain the
learned knowledge and use it in subsequent learning. Unlike this isolated system, humans learn
effectively with only a few examples precisely because our learning is very knowledge-driven:
the knowledge learned in the past helps us learn new things with little data or effort. Lifelong
learning aims to emulate this capability, because without it, an AI system cannot be considered
truly intelligent.

<p>
Research in lifelong learning has developed significantly in the relatively short time since
the first edition of this book was published. The purpose of this second edition is to expand the
definition of lifelong learning, update the content of several chapters, and add a new chapter
about continual learning in deep neural networks—which has been actively researched over the
past two or three years. A few chapters have also been reorganized to make each of them more
coherent for the reader. Moreover, the authors want to propose a unified framework for the
research area. Currently, there are several research topics in machine learning that are closely
related to lifelong learning—most notably, multi-task learning, transfer learning, and meta-learning because they also employ the idea of knowledge sharing and transfer. This book brings
all these topics under one roof and discusses their similarities and differences. Its goal is to introduce
this emerging machine learning paradigm and present a comprehensive survey and review
of the important research results and latest ideas in the area. This book is thus suitable for students,
researchers, and practitioners who are interested in machine learning, data mining, natural
language processing, or pattern recognition. Lecturers can readily use the book for courses in
any of these related fields.

<b>Lifelong Machine Learning</b> or <b>Lifelong Learning</b> (LL) is an 
advanced machine learning (ML) paradigm that learns continuously, 
accumulates the knowledge learned in the past, and uses/adapts it to help 
future learning and problem solving. In the process, the learner 
becomes more and more knowledgeable and better and better at learning. 
This continuous learning ability is one of the hallmarks of human intelligence.
However, the current dominant ML paradigm learns in isolation: given a
training dataset, it runs a ML algorithm only on the dataset to produce 
a model. It makes no attempt to retain the learned knowledge and 
use it in subsequent learning. 
Although this isolated ML paradigm, primarily based on datadriven
optimization, has been very successful, it requires a large number 
of training examples, and is only suitable for well-defined and narrow 
tasks in closed environments. In contrast, we humans learn effectively
with a few examples and in the dynamic and open world because our learning 
is also very much knowledge-driven: the knowledge
learned in the past helps us learn new things with little data or 
effort and adapt to new/unseen situations. LL aims to achieve this 
capability. Applications such as chatbots, self-driving cars, or any AI
systems that interact with humans/physical environments are calling for 
this capability because they need to cope with their dynamic and open 
environments which leave them with no choice but to continuously learn new 
things in order to function well. Without the LL capability, an AI 
system cannot be considered truly intelligent. 

<h3> <font color=red>Main changes to the first edition</font></h3>
<ul>
<li> Expanded the definition/scope of lifelong learning (LL) in Chapter 1  
<a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/lifelong-learning/introduction-lifelong-learning.pdf">Introduction</a>. LL is <b>characterized by</b> 1) <i>continuous learning process</i>, 2) <i>knowledge accumulation</i>, 3) <i>use/adapt past knowledge to help new learning</i>, 4) <i>learning in the open world</i>, and 5) <i>learning on the job</i>. 
<li>Added three new chapters: Chapter 4 <a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/lifelong-learning/continual-learning.pdf">Continual Learning and Catastrophic Forgetting</a>, Chapter 5 <a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/lifelong-learning/open-world-learning.pdf">Open-world Learning</a>, Chapter 8 <a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/lifelong-learning/lifelong-learning-in-dialogues.pdf">Continuous Knowledge Learning in Chatbots</a>
<li> Introduced the concept of <i><b>learning on the job</b></i> or <i><b>learning while working</b></i>. </li> 
<li> Updated and/or reorganized the rest of the chapters.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Lifelong Machine Learning (or Lifelong Learning) is an 
advanced machine learning paradigm that
learns continuously, accumulates the knowledge learned 
in previous tasks, and uses it to help
future learning. In the process, the learner becomes 
more and more knowledgeable and effective at
learning. This learning ability is one of the hallmarks 
of human intelligence. However, the current
dominant machine learning paradigm learns in isolation: 
given a training dataset, it runs a machine
learning algorithm on the dataset to produce a model. 
It makes no attempt to retain the learned
knowledge and use it in future learning. Although this 
isolated learning paradigm has been very
successful, it requires a large number of training examples, 
and is only suitable for well-defined
and narrow tasks. In comparison, we humans can learn effectively 
with a few examples because
we have accumulated so much knowledge in the past which 
enables us to learn with little data or
effort. Lifelong learning aims to achieve this capability. 
As statistical machine learning matures,
it is time to make a major effort to break the isolated 
learning tradition and to study lifelong
learning to bring machine learning to new heights. 
Applications such as intelligent assistants,
chatbots, and physical robots that interact with humans 
and systems in real-life environments are
also calling for such lifelong learning capabilities. 
Without the ability to accumulate the learned
knowledge and use it to learn more knowledge incrementally, 
a system will probably never be
truly intelligent. This book serves as an introductory text 
and survey to lifelong learning. -->
