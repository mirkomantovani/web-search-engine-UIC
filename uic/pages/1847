<p>For UIC senior Melissa Romeo, the Honors Capstone project is more than just an assignment. Romeo—who is majoring in art history with a minor in psychology—is situating her Capstone project as the basis for future exploration.</p>
<p>The Art History course AH 160: “Trends in International Contemporary Art Since 1960” inspired her to formulate her project around Andrea Fraser, a performance artist who created pieces that analyze the intimate physical relationships among humans. In engaging with Fraser’s work, Romeo decided to use psychoanalysis to examine the dichotomy between expectations of the emotions involved in physical relationship and the reality of today’s society. As a result, Romeo has begun to see art as an incorporation of many fields that go far beyond what meets the eye.</p>
<p>Romeo’s Capstone represents “personal progression” and a contemporary twist on her passion for Italian Renaissance Art.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Her project presently consists of conducting research on Fraser as Romeo attempts to determine whether the artist explores questions of physical alienation or hope resulting from societal expectations of physical relationships. Romeo thanks her Fellow Professor Hannah Higgins, her Capstone Supervisor Dr. Elise Archias, and the Honors College for assisting her throughout the development of her Capstone. Both her Supervisor and her Fellow helped Romeo select her Capstone topic and continue to support her by giving her feedback every step of the way. They make sure that her project has a concrete focus, and ultimately have helped her make it her own.</p>
<p>Romeo is currently working at an art gallery—which has also influenced her Capstone project—and she hopes to establish a career in art therapy. Romeo wants to have an impact on other students before she leaves UIC and encourages them to use their Capstone projects as a springboard, one that is “ongoing, accelerated, [and] forever expanding [an] idea that may someday become their life.”</p>

But how might that response be different for children in the foster care system? Who would they consider the important people in their lives? These<br />
are the types of questions that drive the Taylor Duke [above] will be research of Taylor Duke, an Honors College junior majoring in psychology.</p>
</div>

<p>key themes—for example, a plan to go to college or get a job— and uses the information to assess how these VIPs have affected the adolescents’ lives financially and emotionally. She found that generally adolescents in the foster care system have very positive relationships with their VIPs (foster parents, social workers, teachers, etc.). Duke believes that this information will help tremendously in understanding the relationships that foster care youth experience.</p>
<p>Because her findings offer such a unique insight, she will be delivering a presentation at a conference for the Society for Research on Adolescence in Austin, Texas on March 20, 2014. Fellow Honors College student Dulce Diaz will also attend the conference and will give a presentation entitled: “Honors College: Supporting Students to Succeed in University”. The conference spans an entire weekend and will feature displays from undergraduates like Duke and Diaz, as well as presentations from graduate students and professionals in the field. Duke also plans on submitting her work to the Journal of Adolescent Research, a peer-reviewed national science journal. She notes that her most impressive accomplishment so far is that she found a way to combine her research with topics that she is passionate about. “I have always loved working with children. [That’s] what I hope to do as a career,” Duke says. “I am so glad I got to do this project!”</p>

<p>The Capstone project provides an opportunity for Honors College seniors to pursue topics that they are passionate about and demonstrate what they have learned. Senior Hugh Vondracek, a political science major, is completing not one, but two major research projects, and was kind enough to share his experiences with the Ampersand.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Vondracek completed his first research project during his junior year, when he worked with Professor Yue Zhang on a qualitative and comparative analysis of Sudanese rivalry.This project focused on discussing and creating solutions to the underlying economic and political struggles of modern day Sudan, such as oil and resource distribution. Vondracek truly feels drawn to this topic, remarking, “I’m interested in the Sudanese rivalry because it is an opportunity to learn more about this dangerous phenomenon.” Furthermore, Vondracek worked on expanding the depth of current research available on the topic of rivalry in the Sudanese population. He presented his findings at the Annual Conference of the Midwest Political Science Association in April of 2013, which was the culmination of his year’s work. Vondracek was also awarded the LAS Undergraduate Research Initiative Grant by UIC to further fund his work on the Sudanese economic and political systems.</p>
<p><a href="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Optimized-Hugh-Senior-Capstone.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-624" src="http://ampersand.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Optimized-Hugh-Senior-Capstone.jpg" alt="Optimized-Hugh-Senior Capstone" width="151" height="300" /></a>However, he hasn’t stopped there. Vondracek is devoting his senior Capstone to another topic he is passionate about: the relationship between stadium construction in China, foreign policy, and nation building. Vondracek is currently exploring the principles of control implemented by China by writing about its influence in the Asian subcontinent, another area of special interest for him.</p>
<p>Apart from the joy of pursuing topics that captivate him, Vondracek feels that the Capstone prepared him to become a critical thinker and eloquent presenter. He also believes that his projects have helped him to plan out his future. As a result of his experience with the Capstone project, he hopes to pursue a graduate degree and continue research in the field of political science.</p>

		<p>At the annual Honors College Research Symposium—which was held this past fall on November 20<sup>th</sup>—twenty-six Honors College students presented their engaging projects. The presentations had eye-catching titles in a variety of disciplines; a few examples included: “History of the Solvability of Polynomial Equations by Radicals” by Eid Reem, “How to Break Tradition? Marketing Soccer in the U.S.” by Stefan Tabutov, and “Female Horror Villains and the Last Girl” by Morgan Valenzuela. One presenter, senior political science major Medzit Redzepi, exhibited a poster entitled “Macedonia’s Accession into the EU”. He reflected on his experience saying, “I think that it is fantastic that we get these opportunities to share our work with our peers and professors. [They] give good advice on future improvements and ask you really good questions that really open your mind.” Redzepi also noted that as a presenter he had the opportunity to view other students’ posters, which allowed him to meet new people and broaden his perspectives on different areas of study. Redzepi was extremely grateful for the experience he gained from his presentation at the Fall Symposium. The event was also a great opportunity for students to see examples of undergraduate research in general and to obtain ideas for their own Capstone projects.</p>
<p>This spring the campus-wide Student Research Forum will highlight undergraduate, graduate, and professional student research from diverse fields and disciplines. It will be held on April 8<sup>th</sup>, 2014 at the UIC Forum. The categories are Art/Design/Humanities, Business/Computer Science/Mathematics, Engineering/Physical Sciences, Life Sciences, and Social Sciences. Awards are given to top student research projects in each category as well as presentations that best display the spirit of sustainability. Honors College students are encouraged to participate again this year, as they have done in the past. At the Student Research Forum (SRF) last year, nearly 3/4 of the undergraduate student presenters and 12 of the 13 award winners were Honors College students.</p>
<p>Students who are interested in presenting at the Student Research Forum are encouraged to submit an abstract online prior to March 24<sup>th</sup>. All students are encouraged to learn about the many opportunities for undergraduate research and to explore ideas for future Honors Capstone projects by attending the Student Research Forum.</p>
